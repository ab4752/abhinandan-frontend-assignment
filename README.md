# Table App with Pagination and Sorting

## Project Overview

This project is a dynamic web application that displays a table with data, supports sorting, pagination, dark mode, and focuses on **accessibility** for a better user experience. The data is fetched from an external API and displayed in a tabular format with an option to sort the columns. The table's pagination allows the user to navigate through the data efficiently. The app also supports dark mode for improved user experience.

### Key Features:
- **Data Display**: Displays a table with data fetched from an API.
- **Pagination**: Allows users to navigate through large datasets with pagination controls.
- **Sorting**: Users can sort data by clicking on column headers.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Accessibility**: The application has been built with accessibility in mind. It ensures proper screen reader support and provides keyboard navigation for users with disabilities. Elements such as buttons and form controls are labeled correctly, and appropriate ARIA roles are added.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **CSS**: TailwindCSS for styling
